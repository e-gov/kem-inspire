KeM Inspire v√µrguteenuste GeoServeri app-schemad ja SLD kujundused.

GeoServer app-schemas and SLD styles for Inspire network services.

## Background
This repository is an effort by the [Estonian Ministry of the Environment
IT Centre](http://kemit.ee) for building Inspire compliant view
and download services using [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/)'s
[app-schemas](http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/index.html).

@todo - make this thicker, write a bit more on why we are doing this? who
else is known to be using GS (check thematic clusters). list data themes
we know we'll be covering. what kind of workflow we'll be using?
contributions how-to?

As [Inspire](http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/) is a pan-European effort
the working language for this repository is English.

## GeoServer setup
@todo - write a how-to guide how to get things up and running.
